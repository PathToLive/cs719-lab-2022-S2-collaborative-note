# cs719 2022 S2 Collaborative Note

## Motivation

- Practicing development collaboration using Git.
- Documenting and organizing shared class notes/cheat sheets.
- Having the OPENSOURCE SPIRIT right at the start.

## How to get involved?

This repository starts with a single folder and three simple html files, including fqa.html, `course_note.html`, `glossary.html`.

- `fqa.html` is supposed to contain some frequently asked quetions and the corresponding answers. 
- `course_note.html` is supposed to contain course summary or tips provided by the volunteering students.
- `glossary.html` has a table which contains all the jargon or new vocabulary that students learn throughout the course.


As the course unfolded, besides contributing more information/shared notes, students can also add more functionality into this repository by potentially integrating css, javascript or node.js.

## Policy

- This is a fully student driven repository. The teaching staff might occasionally contribute, but not guaranteed.
- This repository also has been setup with "peer review" requirement, which means when merging a pull request to the main branch more than one review and approval from contributors other than the author himself/herself is required.
- There is no other policy from this point. Student can discuss and expand policy to make the collaboration more consistent and organised.
